## Notes

- The [excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) library is bundled into the plugin.
- It was only tested in the MacOS Desktop App (but should in theory work across all apps)
- This project refers to the [ThibaultJanBeyer/joplin-sheets](https://github.com/ThibaultJanBeyer/joplin-sheets) project, thank you
